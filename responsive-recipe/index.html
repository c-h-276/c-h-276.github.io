            <h4>Crust Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pulse graham crackers and brown sugar in a food processor into a fine
                crumb. You can also grind them in a zipped top bag with a rolling pin or your hands</ol>
            <ol>Simultaneously, pour in the melted salted butter and pulse the graham cracker mixture until the butter
                is
                combined. You can also combine them in a bowl with a spatula</ol>
            <ol>In a 9 or 10 inch pie dish, press the graham cracker mixture into the bottom and up the sides. Use the
                bottom of a small glass or measuring cup and your hands to compact the mixture. Bake for 7-8 minutes
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="instructions2">
            <h4>Pie Filling & Baking Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>While the pie crust bakes, make the filling. Add the pumpkin, buttermilk, eggs, unsalted butter, brown
                sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl. Using an
                electric/stand mixer or a whisk, mix together the filling until well combined</ol>
            <ol>Pour the pumpkin filling into the pre-baked crust</ol>
            <ol>Use a spatula to smooth out the filling gently. The pie will be filled to the very top</ol>
            <ol>Bake for 45-55 minutes depending on the size of your pie dish. At the 25-30 minute mark, cover the edges
                of
                the pie with foil or a pie crust shield so the edges do not burn. A 9-inch pie will take MORE time than
                a
                10-inch pie. I recommend checking the temperature of the center or pie with a thermometer. It is done
                when
                the center is 180-185 degrees. The middle will still look wobbly and unset. It will continue to set as
                it
                cools</ol>
            <ol>Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 2-3 hours. The center will drop and the pie will level
                as
                it cools. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator once cooled. Serve with whipped cream</ol>
