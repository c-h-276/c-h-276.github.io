    <div id="Paragraph1">
        <p>The rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron macrophyllum</i>) are Washington state’s state flower. There are two distinct types, the pacific rhododendron and the<br>
            California rhododendron, each native to their respective namesakes. Rhododendrons grow as bushes or shrubs, not reaching very far up ranging from<br>
            3-15 feet tall. They are evergreen plants, and have long, oval-shaped leaves about 3-8 inches depending on the limb size. Their flowers grow in<br>
            bushels and appear from early spring to late summer, making it a wonderful plant to keep in your front lawn. It’s also perennial, meaning it will<br>
            come back every single year, as bushes usually do. Although they don’t flower until 5 years old. Although the bushes are mainly toxic to most animals<br>
            and people to eat and carry little nutritional value, these plants are home to a variety of the local ecosystem. Bees use the flowers to pollinate and<br>
            take nectar for hives and small animals will make the underside of the bush their home. </p>

    <div id="Paragraph2">
        <p>When taking care of a rhododendron it’s important to note the aspects of the plant. It grows the best under mostly sunny or full sun areas, it flowers<br>
            from May to July, the way to propagate is from seed cutting or layering, and it doesn’t have a prefrence for any type of soil and grows well in anything.<br>
            Be careful when consuming honey if you have rhododendrons around. This species specifically contains the compound andromedotoxin, which can poison honey<br>
            in beehives if the nectar is used. The symptoms of rhododendron honey poisoning are gastro-intestinal upset as well as alterations in heart rate and blood<br>
            pressure. It’s also called “<i>mad honey disease</i>”.</p>
