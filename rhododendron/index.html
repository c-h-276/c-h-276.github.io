    <p>Rhododendrons (Rhododendron macrophyllum) are Washington state’s state flower. There are two distinct types, the
        pacific rhododendron and the California rhododendron, each native to their respective namesakes.

        Rhododendrons grow as bushes or shrubs, not reaching very far up ranging from 3-15 feet tall. They are evergreen
        plants, and have long, oval-shaped leaves about 3-8 inches depending on the limb size.

        Their flowers grow in bushels and appear from early spring to late summer, making it a wonderful plant to keep
        in your front lawn. It’s also perennial, meaning it will come back every single year, as bushes usually do.
        Although they don’t flower until 5 years old.

        Although the bushes are mainly toxic to most animals and people to eat and carry little nutritional value, these
        plants are home to a variety of the local ecosystem. Bees use the flowers to pollinate and take nectar for hives
        and small animals will make the underside of the bush their home. </p>
    <p>When taking care of a rhododendron it’s important to note the aspects of the plant. It grows the best under
        mostly sunny or full sun areas, it flowers from May to July, the way to propagate is from seed cutting or
        layering, and it doesn’t have a prefrence for any type of soil and grows well in anything.

        Be careful when consuming honey if you have rhododendrons around. This species specifically contains the
        compound andromedotoxin, which can poison honey in beehives if the nectar is used. The symptoms of rhododendron
        honey poisoning are gastro-intestinal upset as well as alterations in heart rate and blood pressure. It’s also
        called “mad honey disease”.</p>
