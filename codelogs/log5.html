    <h1>Code Log 5: Images</h1>
    <section>
        <h4>What are the differences between presenting an image using an HTML tag (like "img") and presenting it as the
            background of an HTML element (using the CSS property background-image)?</h4>
        <p>A regular image is stated as apart of the main page, which includes being on the same layer as the text on
            that page. Using the background-image element, the image will then go to the back of the webpage and the
            text can then overlay on top of it without collisions or masking. Background-image can also be used for
            decorative images that serve no purpose other than aesthetic ability for the webpage, and regular images
            will be included as normal decals with more detail.</p>
            <hr>
        <h4>Besides background-image, what other CSS properties affect the display of background images?</h4>
        <p>Background-origin: Defines the origin area of the background image for the position using padding, border or
            content boxes</p>
        <p>Background-attachment: Makes the background content scroll with the site or stay in place using scroll or
            fixed</p>
            <hr>
        <h4>In one sentence, how would you define the differences between dimensions and resolution in a bitmap image?
        </h4>
        <p>Dimentions are the actual size of an image with respect to a measurement, resolution is only defined as how
            we see the image, in other words, dimentions are tangeble and resolution is not.</p>
            <hr>
        <h4>What are the similarities and differences between these image file formats? Why are some better than others
            for specific uses?</h4>
        <p>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): Rastor file type, and mainly is used for short animations. Quality
            dependant on the complexity of the image/animation. Does NOT support transparency</p>
        <p>PNG (Portable Network Graphics): Rastor file type. Absolutely no quality loss, but is usually the largest out
            of all the files listed</p>
        <p>JPG/JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): Rastor file type, and is the standard format for digital
            cameras. Does NOT support transparency. The compression is not as good as WebP because the more compression,
            the bigger reduction in quality</p>
        <p>WebP (Web Picture Format): Rastor file type. Best for file size reduction and supports transpaprency. Not all
            platforms support it, but it keeps photo quality while reducing file sizes</p>
        <p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Vector file type. No quality loss, and small file type. Supports
            transparency</p>
