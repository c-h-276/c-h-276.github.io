            <h2>Explain the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units.</h2>
            <p>Absolute units specify a value that is fixed at length. This means when the screen resolution changes, the value will stay the same no matter what.</p>
            <p>Relative units are units that are not fixed, and will change with a resolution change.</p>
