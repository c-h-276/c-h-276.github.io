        <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
        <p>Media queries are things that allow the you to tweak the proportions of your website's sections, fonts, and
            pictures according to the size of the screen used to view it. It is useful when telling a printer to print
            off a webpage. Since the webpage needs to be reformatted to a printer page size, this reformats the page so
            it will print correctly, instead of being too big or too small. It can also help choose a different image (if
            specified) if the original image doesn't fit the media's scale. You can state a media query using the term
            @media within a specified "style", "picture", or any HTML elements that use the size= or media= additions.</p>

        <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries -- such as "orientation" or "max-width" -- and what do they do? Pick any 4 to explain.</h2>
        <p>Media features that are supported by media queries include
            <ul>
                <li>Min/max width and height (length): Specifies the size of a viewport</li>
                <li>Min/max resolution (resolution): States the resolution/quality of a viewport</li>
                <li>Color (integer): Finds the color support of a device</li>
                <li>Hover (hover/none): Checks if the mouse is allowed a "hover" over these elements</li>
            </ul>
