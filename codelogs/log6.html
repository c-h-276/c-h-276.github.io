    <h1>Code Log 6: Reference Quest</h1>
    <section>
        <h3>Pick one aspect of web coding — an HTML tag, a CSS property, or something else related to HTML/CSS — and
            look it up on four (4) different resources:</h3>
        <p>Sources:</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_li.asp">W3Schools</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/li">Mozilla</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-li-tag">GeeksForGeeks</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://html.com/tags/li">HTML</a></li>
        <h4>What did you look up?</h4>
        <p>I looked up the tag for list, <"li">
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>What are the differences in the information presented on each site?</h4>
        <p>Each website contains the same information, but is formatted slightly differently. They all include how the
            tag aknowleges that something is an item in a list, how this tag would be used to simplify and structure
            content better, and an example of the code. However, only three included which browsers supported this tag.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>What features do you think a code reference page should offer?</h4>
        <p>I think a reference page should include an explination of the code and why it was made, show how the code is
            used in an example, show similar tags that might be used with this tag, and a series of browsers this tag is
            supported by.</p>
        <h4>Do any of your 4 resources stand out as particularly good or bad?</h4>
        <p>None of them stood out as good or bad, as they all gave me the same general basic information about the list
            tag, however, HTML and W3Schools do make the website hard to read for me as the description of the tag is
            not up at the top of the page, rather it's near the middle of it.</p>
