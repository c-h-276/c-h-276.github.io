    <h1>Code Log 4: CSS Color</h1>
    <section>
        <p>CSS uses the tag <color> to indicate a color of another tag. This color could also include a transparency value,
            indicating how opaque it is. Although colors may vary on different devices and screens, you can use similar
            methods to decide which color you want to use.</p>
        <p>You can use the following formats and more to explain colors:</p>
        <p>Named – These colors are already predetermined by the browser to have names, such as blue, red, brown, yellow, etc.</p>
        <p>Hexadecimal – The hex code of a color is characterized by a string of lower or uppercase letters and numbers, where the color is specified by #RRGGBB, red red, green green, blue blue. Each of these values are in between 00 and ff. </p>
        <p>Syntax: #rrbbgg</p>
        <p>RGB (Red, Green, Blue) - Each color will be represented as a number as an integer between 0 and 255, or as a percentage value from 0% to 100%.</p>
        <p>Syntax: rgb(red, green, blue)</p>
        <p>HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) - Similar to RGB, HSL represents a degree-based color wheel that shows what color is picked based off the number of degrees, then saturation in percentage, then lightness in percentage of black to white.</p>
        <p>Syntax: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The CSS properties that use the colors we provide are:</p>
        <p>Color – Specifies the color of text.</p>
        <p>Background-color – This sets the background color of an element, this includes the full padding and border of an element.</p>
        <p>Border-color - To make a border of a specified element, this is also broken up into up to 4 different properties, top border, right border, left border, and the bottom border. The element can be broken up into less borders by adding less values to the border-color property.</p>
