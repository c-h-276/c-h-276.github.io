            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to convection 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                <li>Mix cream cheese with sugar and vanilla with whisk (by hand) or whisk attachment (on stand mixer). Once well combined, scoop cream cheese in 1 tbsp balls (14-16 grams) onto a parchment paper lined tray/plate. Place this in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. (Should come out to about 12 cream cheese balls.)</li>
                <li>To start cookie dough, beat room temperature butter in stand mixer/by hand for 3-5 minutes (or until butter turns off-white)</li>
                <li>Add in brown sugar and white sugar to your butter. Beat the sugar with the butter until the mixture is fluffy (about 2 minutes)</li>
                <li>Add your large egg and stir into mixture</li>
                <li>Mix in vanilla extract, strawberry extract, and red/pink food coloring</li>
                <li>Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to form your dough. If using a stand mixer, mix on low. If mixing by hand, use a spatula</li>
                <li>Use a &frac13; cup scoop (approximately 80 grams) (or however much your heart desires) and place a single ball of dough on baking tray. THIS IS YOUR TEST COOKIE! Always start with baking a single cookie, to make sure you didn’t forget an ingredient and/or your oven isn’t too hot (some ovens have hot-spots or cook things quicker/slower than others). This is also a good indicator of how much your cookie will spread</li>
                <li>If your test cookie came out flat, add a couple more tablespoons of flour to allow cream cheese to stay in the center of the cookie when baking</li>
                <li>If your cream cheese balls are frozen well, flatten out your cookie dough in your palm and place 1 cream cheese ball in the center. Fold the cookie dough around until it is well secured in the center</li>
                <li>Pour sugar into a separate bowl and roll cookie dough in</li>
                <li>Bake cookies for 10-11 minutes (for &frac13; cup scoop)</li>
                <li>For perfectly circular cookies, use a circular bowl/cup/cookie cutter and swirl around your fresh cookie to make edges clean. Then let cookies sit on tray for about 10 minutes before removing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can eat these fresh and/or put these in the fridge to store up to 10 days</p>
