            <h4>Icing Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>Combine your icing sugar, lemon juice and vanilla extract in a medium bowl until it has a smooth and
                runny consistency. If it needs to be thinned more, add a few drops of water or more lemon juice</ol>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions2">
            <h4>Cookie Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</ol>
            <ol>Start by making your chamomile lemon sugar where all of your flavor will come from. Do this by grinding
                up your granulated sugar, the juice and zest of one of your lemons, and lavender. I use a mortar and
                pestle, but a food processor or blender works great too. Add your powdered sugar and mix</ol>
            <ol>Cream butter with your lavender lemon sugar until well incorporated and fluffy</ol>
            <ol>Sift in the flour and cornstarch and gradually mix</ol>
            <ol>You will need to get your hands dirty and really mix well to incorporate all of the butter into the
                flour. Work it with your hands until the dough becomes a ball. <em>At this point, you can chill the
                    dough if you’re not ready to bake, but it’s usually not necessary with this dough.</em> If it’s easy
                to handle, go ahead and continue to next step. If it’s too soft, refrigerate for 20 minutes</ol>
            <ol>On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough about ? inch thick. Cut into desired shapes. I used an
                embossed rolling pin for the texture and tea bag cookie cutter for the shape</ol>
            <ol>Bake for 12 minutes. Longer if you want them golden brown and more crisp (my personal preference) But
                they should be done and have a nice crumb, and still be pale at 12 minutes if your oven temperature is
                correct. Let cookies cool on cookie sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack</ol>
            <ol>Let them cool completely and make your icing</ol>
            <ol>Dip your cookies into the icing when they’re completely cooled so they’re hard and cool enough to handle</ol>
            <ol>Let them dry for one hour to let icing completely harden, and enjoy!</ol>

        <div class="instructions1">
            <h4>Crust Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Pulse graham crackers and brown sugar in a food processor into a fine
                crumb. You can also grind them in a zipped top bag with a rolling pin or your hands</ol>
            <ol>Simultaneously, pour in the melted salted butter and pulse the graham cracker mixture until the butter
                is
                combined. You can also combine them in a bowl with a spatula</ol>
            <ol>In a 9 or 10 inch pie dish, press the graham cracker mixture into the bottom and up the sides. Use the
                bottom of a small glass or measuring cup and your hands to compact the mixture. Bake for 7-8 minutes
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions2">
            <h4>Pie Filling & Baking Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>While the pie crust bakes, make the filling. Add the pumpkin, buttermilk, eggs, unsalted butter, brown
                sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a large bowl. Using an
                electric/stand mixer or a whisk, mix together the filling until well combined</ol>
            <ol>Pour the pumpkin filling into the pre-baked crust</ol>
            <ol>Use a spatula to smooth out the filling gently. The pie will be filled to the very top</ol>
            <ol>Bake for 45-55 minutes depending on the size of your pie dish. At the 25-30 minute mark, cover the edges
                of
                the pie with foil or a pie crust shield so the edges do not burn. A 9-inch pie will take MORE time than
                a
                10-inch pie. I recommend checking the temperature of the center or pie with a thermometer. It is done
                when
                the center is 180-185 degrees. The middle will still look wobbly and unset. It will continue to set as
                it
                cools</ol>
            <ol>Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 2-3 hours. The center will drop and the pie will level
                as
                it cools. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator once cooled. Serve with whipped cream</ol>
