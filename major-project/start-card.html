	    <p><br>This is a game about a man who goes on a blind date with a girl.<br><br><br>
	    The objective of this game is to have fun and answer as truthfully as you would if you were on the date.<br><br><br>
	    The purpose of this game is to express a feeling I've had for a very long time, and to aid the male loneliness epidemic by promoting empathy.<br><br><br>
	    Note that any and all depictions in this game are purely fictional.<br><br><br>
	    Please have fun and enjoy.<br><br><br><br><br>
	    And remember,<br><br><br>
