        K: "My favorite genres are science fiction and bibliography.
        "And the occasional fantasy."
        "My most recent reads have been interesting. I just finsihed reading Annihilation from Jeff Vandermeer."

        M: "How was it?"

        K: "Alright. I thought the writing was good but the ending kind of weirded me out."

        M: "Really? I was going to ask if that was a reccomendation but I guess not."

        K: "Yeah. I would rather introduce you to some more popular classics like Orwell's 1989 or The Martian. Stuff
        that's GOOD-good."

        M: "Good to know!"
